what is middleware

suppose we have a client and he clicks on a url (/instagram)

so the process will be like there will a (req, res)
req -> which client has sended
res -> res can be like
        1. res.json
        2. res.send
        it can be anything...
        now suppose the req is like res.send("ms")
        so we have to check if the client has logged in or not
        
    so this check which we perform in the middle is known as middleware


some more knowledge...

there are four things 

(err, req, res, next)
